            <div class="export-right">
                <p>The entire process, from sourcing to the final delivery of goods to customers, is scrupulously managed to ensure adherence to the strict quality standards required. Price is no doubt an important criterion, but the Eemphasis is on consistent quality where procurement of raw and packing material is concerned. While incoming goods are subject to thorough quality inspections, all suppliers of raw and packing material are periodically audited for compliance to quality guidelines. Wherever and whenever necessary, we provide advice to assist suppliers to improve their processes. Our Quality Assurance team does an excellent job in this respect. We also ensure that all imported ingredients are sourced from reputed and quality certified organisations.</p>

                <p>
                    The commissary is fully mechanised. Modern equipment is used for mixing, proofing to baking and blast freezing. The entire process takes place under strict hygienic controls, untouched by human hand. All equipment, especially those used for measuring, are subject to regular maintenance, monitoring and calibration. Quality Assurance checks are performed on all product batches. An important aspect of commissary hygiene is our programme of pest control, which aspect is also subject to quality checks.

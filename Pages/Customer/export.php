                Exports of frozen baked products is another of our success stories. Exports of our baked
                goods commenced several years back. We initially targeted hotels, restaurants and retail
                outlets in those countries. Starting with the Maldives and Seychelles, we expanded our
                export horizons to the USA, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong a few years later.
                The expatriate Sri Lankan community in those countries were targeted with typical Sri Lankan products.
                Our current list of countries in our Exports Account are USA, Australia, Maldives,
                New Zealand & South Korea.
                Our efforts were crowned with success. What commenced with one 20’ FCL Freezer
                Container in every quarter is now increased to two to three 20’ FCL Freezer Containers
                a month. For the long term, we intend to further penetrate the local communities of
                those countries as well. Currently, we are the only organization to offer a complete
                package of baked products for exports.
